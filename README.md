# Roadmap
December 28th, 2025 - project started, first video released

# Support
<b>Supports from Windows 95 up to Windows 11 (Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT 4.1+, Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and 8.1, Windows 10, Windows 11)</b>
<br><b>Supports Windows Server: Windows Server NT 4.0, Widows Server 2000, Widows Server 2003, Widows Server 2008, Widows Small Business Server 2008, Widows Server 2012, Widows Server 2012 R2, Widows Server 2016, Widows Server 2019, Widows Server 2022, Widows Server 2025
<br>Supports Windows CE: Windows CE 1.0, Windows CE 2.0, Windows CE 2.1, Windows CE 2.11, Windows CE 2.12, Windows CE 3.0, Windows CE .NET 4.1, Windows CE .NET 4.2 
<br>
<br><i>Note: Windows 95 and Windows 98 requires MSVCVB6.dll runtime DLL to function, which is included in the program installer</i>
<br>
<br>---------> On Windows 95 and 98, you might get violation errors due to an attempt of accessing C:\Win32 by the installer. In that case, press "Ignore" for the missing .dlls and the program will function correctly. <---------
<br>
<br><b>The program will be tested on Windows CE 6 once it is in a useable stage. Windows CE 6 is the intended OS for the program, as most ATMs run it.</b>

# Principles
* Maximum speed, ease-of-use and efficiency
* Security
* Easy installation and portability - no dependencies need to be installed by system admin
* Overall user convenience and ease of use
* Past, present and future compatibility with Windows, working on Windows CE

# Why?
* I wanted to learn and practice legacy frontend and backend development in Visual Basic 6 and COBOL, also learning about how ATMs and Windows CE 6 operate.
* Visual Basic has greater compatibility - it supports from Windows 95 up to Windows 11 (Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0 and 4.1, Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and 8.1, Windows 10, Windows 11), including Windows Server NT 4.0, Widows Server 2000, Widows Server 2003, Widows Server 2008, Widows Small Business Server 2008, Widows Server 2012, Widows Server 2012 R2, Widows Server 2016, Widows Server 2019, Widows Server 2022, Widows Server 2025, Windows CE 1.0, Windows CE 2.0, Windows CE 2.1, Windows CE 2.11, Windows CE 2.12, Windows CE 3.0, Windows CE .NET 4.1, Windows CE .NET 4.2
