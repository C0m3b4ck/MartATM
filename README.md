# Roadmap
December 27th, 2025 - project started, first video released

# Support - IMPORTANT
<br><b>Currently, due to the use of stock VB6, the only supported Windows versions are the desktop versions of Windows 95 up to Windows 11.</b>
<br><b>A significant rewrite, probably in eC++, is coming not-so-soon.</b>
<br><h2><b>The program will be tested on Windows CE 6 once it is in a useable stage. Windows CE 6 is the intended OS for the program, as most legacy ATMs run it.</b></h2>

# Principles
* Maximum speed, ease-of-use and efficiency
* Security
* Easy installation and portability - no dependencies need to be installed by system admin
* Overall user convenience and ease of use
* Past, present and future compatibility with Windows, working on Windows CE

# Why?
* I wanted to learn and practice legacy frontend and backend development in Visual Basic 6 and COBOL, also learning about how ATMs and Windows CE 6 operate.
* Visual Basic has greater compatibility - it supports from Windows 95 up to Windows 11 (Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0 and 4.1, Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and 8.1, Windows 10, Windows 11), including Windows Server NT 4.0, Widows Server 2000, Widows Server 2003, Widows Server 2008, Widows Small Business Server 2008, Widows Server 2012, Widows Server 2012 R2, Widows Server 2016, Widows Server 2019, Widows Server 2022, Widows Server 2025, Windows CE 1.0, Windows CE 2.0, Windows CE 2.1, Windows CE 2.11, Windows CE 2.12, Windows CE 3.0, Windows CE .NET 4.1, Windows CE .NET 4.2
