# Roadmap
December 27th, 2025 - project started, first video released

# Support - IMPORTANT
<br><b>Currently, due to the use of stock VB6, the only supported Windows versions are the desktop versions of Windows 95 up to Windows 11.</b>
<br><b>A significant rewrite, probably in eC++, is coming not-so-soon.</b>
<br><h2><b>The program will be tested on Windows CE 6 once it is in a useable stage. Windows CE 6 is the intended OS for the program, as most legacy ATMs run it.</b></h2>

# Principles
* Maximum speed, ease-of-use and efficiency
* Security
* Easy installation and portability - no dependencies need to be installed by system admin
* Overall user convenience and ease of use
* Past, present and future compatibility with Windows, working on Windows CE

# Why?
* I wanted to learn and practice legacy frontend and backend development for Microsoft embedded systems

# Screenshots
Screenshots will appear once I do tests.
